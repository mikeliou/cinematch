# CineMatch

## Project Overview

CineMatch is a conversational AI designed to enhance movie discovery and information retrieval using a sophisticated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline. 
By integrating Qdrant as a Vector Database to manage movie embeddings, employing llama-index as an intermediate module and utilizing gpt-3.5-turbo as the Language Model (LLM), 
CineMatch offers a chat experience where users can learn about movies and get personalized movie recommendations.

## Features

- **Vector Database**: Utilizes Qdrant to store and manage vectors of popular movies.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Combines the retrieval capabilities of a vector database with the generative abilities of a LLM.
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Users can engage with the system to fetch movie data and receive recommendations.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Provides an initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on movies dataset.
